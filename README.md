#Automation of Attendance on Google Forms

This Python script automates the process of taking attendance for a library homework help program using Google Forms.

Program Functionality

The program performs the following tasks:

Reads Attendance Data: The program reads data from a CSV file which includes information such as student name, date, school name, grade, and subject participation.
Logs Into Google Forms: Using Selenium WebDriver, the script navigates to the Google Forms page and logs in with the provided credentials.
Automated Form Filling: The script automatically fills out the Google Form for each student's attendance, accurately capturing details like the date, school name, grade, unique code (if any), and subject participation.
Form Submission Verification: The program includes checks to verify successful form submission. If the form is successfully submitted, the program will navigate to another form to continue the process. If there's an error, the program will stop to prevent data loss or inconsistency.
Updating Attendance Data: After successfully submitting the form, the script marks the corresponding row in the CSV file as processed. This ensures each attendance record is only processed once, even if the script is run multiple times.
Dependencies

The script requires Python 3, Selenium WebDriver, and the Chrome browser. It also requires a CSV file named 'data.csv' with the correct format of attendance data.

Remember to replace any specifics (like file names, URLs, or credentials) to match your actual script. You might also want to add additional sections to your README.md file, such as installation instructions, how to use the program, a section for known issues or limitations, and contact information for support or contributions.
